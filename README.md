# DeepDev - <https://bit.ly/deepdev>
A code-less approach to machine learning - Build models with a drag and drop editor, &amp; DeepDev generates the code for you.


---

## The Process
DeepDev reinvented machine learning by breaking it down to a simple 3 step process that is easy for everyone to follow -  **Load, Build, Generate.**

**1. Load** in your dataset with your training, testing and validation data. You can upload your own dataset(WIP), fetch a dataset from external websites like kaggle(WIP), or choose one of DeepDev's existing practice datasets.

**2. Build** your model using an intuitive drag and drop editor. Simply click and drag features from our toolbox and drop it onto the network builder interface. It's as simple as putting together puzzle pieces!

**3. Generate** the code with just one-click. You can select from two types of code generation, from raw Python code that you can run directly, to Jupyter notebooks which is formatted python code used by machine learning developers.

 
## How It's Built

 - DeepDev is a light-weight web-app built simply using Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - Libraries Used: Sortable.js, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Modernizr, jQuery
